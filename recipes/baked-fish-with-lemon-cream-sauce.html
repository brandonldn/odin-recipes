    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200Â°C<em>all oven types</em></li>
        <li>Place fish in a baking dish - ensure the fish isn't crammed in too snugly. See video or photos in post. Sprinkle both sides of fish with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place butter, cream, garlic, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a microwave proof jug or bowl. Microwave in 2 x 30 sec bursts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle fish with shallots, then pour over sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 - 12 minutes, or until fish is just cooked. Remove from oven and transfer fish to serving plates. Spoon over sauce, and garnish with parsley and lemon wedges if using.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>NOTES</h5>
    <p>Fish - Any fillets or cutlets/steaks about 1.5-2 cm will work great with this because they cook quickly in the oven.</p>
    <p>Great for: Ling, Tilapia, Snapper, Barramundi, Silver Dory, John Dory, Basa, Hokki, Perch, Flathead</p>
    <p>Okay for: very lean fish like Swordfish, tuna (sauce adds richness!) but be VERY careful about not overcooking the fish.</p>
    <p>Not great for: salmon (too fatty, sauce splits), very thin delicate fish like flounder, Dover Sole, small whole fish like sardines or mackerel.</p>
